Fear of missing out . . . is not a valid argument for trashing what you already have. I moved on, happily disconnected from whatever the world’s five billion social-media users were doing with their online lives. So I took a step that would have nauseated an earlier version of myself: I downloaded the TikTok app, while I still could, to find out what all the fuss was about. I swipe up. A new video begins, showing someone selecting shoes at a store. The velocity of the clips and the rawness of their emotion is breathtaking. According to Pew Research, the typical TikTok user never adds information to their account’s “bio” field. The opposite possibility, that a social post could get you fired, might be more likely. I use it pretty much exclusively either to view content that my friends have shared with me, or to look for content to share with my friends and family.
