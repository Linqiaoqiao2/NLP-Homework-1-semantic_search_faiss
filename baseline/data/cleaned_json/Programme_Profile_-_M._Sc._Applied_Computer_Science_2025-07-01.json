  "content": "Programme Profile\nComputer Science is the science of information processing using a computer. It forms the scientific basis for modern information technology, and particularly for the development of software. Accordingly, the development of software for sophisticated application problems is at the core of Applied Computer Science. Applied Computer Science can be understood as an intermediary between Computer Science and respective fields of application. In order to meet both information-based demands placed on modern software systems and the distinctive characteristics of application, experts in Applied Computer Science and general computer science must possess a sound knowledge of informatics, and must also understand the kinds of problems and challenges specific to each field of application. Possible fields of Applied Computer Science include information systems, bioinformatics, medical informatics and computational engineering. In Bamberg, Applied Computer Science is characterised by the fact that applications pertaining to the humanities and social sciences represent the core of the programme. To date, this programme focus is the only one of its kind in Germany!\nThe masterâ€™s programme in Applied Computer Science offers different foci and a broad range of options. Students with a big interest on foundations are able to select from a broad spectrum of theoretic modules; students with a preference for practical work, can choose besides the master thesis two projects, in which they can work on current research topics. The areas of specialization are:\nCurrent approaches and developments in these areas are further investigated in seminars, projects and theses."
