  "content": "Part-time Studies\nAll degree programmes offered by the faculty of Information Systems and Applied Computer Sciences (WIAI) can be studied as part-time courses.\nParticularly for students with children, part-time employment or students with disabilities or chronic illness, part-time studies afford the opportunity to reduce these students’ academic work load during the semester and extend the allotted duration of a particular degree programme.\nPart-time studies extend the standard programme duration of bachelor’s degree programmes offered by the WIAI faculty from 6 or 7 to 12 or 14 semesters. The duration of master’s degree programmes is extended from 3 or 4 semesters to 6 or 8 semesters, respectively.\nNo statement of explanation is required to register for part-time studies. Changing from full-time to part-time is possible in any semester up to the end of the standard period of study of the respective full-time degree programme within the respective enrolment period. Changing from part-time to full-time is possible in any semester within the respective enrolment period, provided that an even number of semesters have been studied in the part-time degree programme previously attended. The required academic course load per semester is accordingly reduced by half.\nNote: Students are obliged to pay the complete fees (the so-called \"Semesterbeitrag\", which consists of a contribution to the student union and the fees for a semester public transport ticket).\nFurther information on part-time studies can be found on the central pages of the university (German only)."
